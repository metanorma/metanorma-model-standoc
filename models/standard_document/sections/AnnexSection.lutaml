class AnnexSection {
  definition {
    Section of document constituting an annex or appendix.
  }
  +subsections: ClauseSection[0..*] {
    Subsections of the annex. Added explicitly because AnnexSection permits hanging paragraphs
    (top-level blocks are included in the section alongside subsections).
  }
}
